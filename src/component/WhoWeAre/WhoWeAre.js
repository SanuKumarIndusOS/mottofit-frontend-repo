            <br></br>
            <p>
              As one of the co-founders of Motto, Leanna Brittis created Motto after
              realizing that the fitness & wellness industry was lacking a marketplace for
              clients & trainers to find each other. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Leanna
              and two friends found themselves scattered in different cities, yet struggled
              with the same problem of finding high-quality personal training. Together
              they realized that no one should have a hard time finding the right
              professionals for their fitness and wellness needs.


            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>While living in New York City, Leanna has had a career with an emphasis on
               both client services and operational/administrative management in the
               public relations, advertising & marketing industries. Now between New York City 
               & Miami, sheâ€™s been able to gain on-ground experience and grow her 
               networks in two cities where wellness & fitness industry are prioritized, and
               adapt these findings to Motto.
